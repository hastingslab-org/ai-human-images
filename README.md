# Evaluating Text-to-Image Generated Photorealistic Images of Human Anatomy

## Overview

Here, we present our novel classifciation system to assess AI generated images for their anatomical correctness. 
We also provide the AI generated images, the annotation results and the scripts for their evaluation, as used in our manuscript.

## AI generated images

The folder *images* contains all the AI generated images. For each model there is one folder which then contains a folder for each prompt.

## Classification System

Our classification system is described in the manuscript, and a graphical representation can be found below.
Furthermore, the manual that outlines the classification system and gives guidance on how to apply it is stored as [error_classification_system_manual.pdf](error_classification_system_manual.pdf).

## Annotations

The folder *data* contains a csv file with all the annotations of the AI generated images. The annotators are anonymised and represented by a simple number.

## How to cite

In review.
